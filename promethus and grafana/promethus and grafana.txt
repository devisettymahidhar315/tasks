kubernetes clusters using prometheus and visualize using grafana.

Prometheus and Grafana are popular open-source monitoring and observability tools commonly used in Kubernetes environments to monitor the health, performance, and metrics of applications and infrastructure.

promethus is the monitoring system
it takes the data from api server. 
promethus show data in json format, which is not good.

so grapahana cames into picture. graphana takes the data from promethus and visulaize the data.


Prometheus Components:
Prometheus Server: Central component responsible for collecting and storing time-series data.
Prometheus Alertmanager: Handles alerts sent by Prometheus server and manages alert notifications.
Prometheus Exporters: Collect metrics from various sources and expose them in a format Prometheus can scrape.
Prometheus Web UI: Provides a graphical interface to explore metrics and execute PromQL queries.

Grafana Components:
Grafana Server: Core component that serves the Grafana web interface and handles data visualization and dashboard rendering.
Grafana Plugins: Extend Grafana's capabilities with additional data sources, panels, and features.
Grafana Dashboards: Pre-built and custom dashboards to visualize metrics and logs from different data sources.


Prometheus scrapes metrics from Kubernetes components, applications, and services using service discovery and custom exporters.
Grafana connects to Prometheus as a data source to visualize the collected metrics and create dashboards for monitoring and observability.

pods present in promethus:

prometheus-prometheus-0: The primary pod on which Prometheus server is deployed.
prometheus-alertmanager-0: The Alertmanager pod, which is used to manage alerts and send notifications.
prometheus-node-exporter-4q4lc: The node exporter pod that collects metrics from the underlying host system and make collected metrics available to the Prometheus UI.
prometheus-pushgateway-c8f8f88bb-dk7c2: The Pushgateway pod to collect metrics from batch jobs or other non-service sources.
prometheus-server-exporter-8wz6h: The server exporter pod to collect metrics from other services running in the same Kubernetes cluster.
