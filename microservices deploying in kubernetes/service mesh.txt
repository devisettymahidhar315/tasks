service mesh:
manages the communication between micro service.


microservice architecture:
bussiness logic
communication configuration
security logic
retry logic
metrics
tracing

service mesh is a pattern. istio is one of the implementation

istio architecture:
in the control plane has istiod.
in the data plane has envoy proxy.
combination of istiod and envoy proxy of all data plane.

user-gateway-virtual service- mtls- webser (microservice)-envoy proxy-code. 

Imp
********
to work with Istio

firstly we need to run this command
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/istio-1.21.2/bin


Imp
Prometheus Monitoring .
Grafana = data visualization
jaeger=open source , for tracing the microservice request
tracing= trace the whole chain.
zipkin=alternative to jaeger

kiali =data visualization for microservice step and communication.
