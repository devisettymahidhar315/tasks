in keycloak server we will add the client , client scope , group and assign the client and scope to groups. after we will come to kubernetes cluster ,apply the rbac yaml files.after we will add the tokens.after user  can access according to their scope.

By following this step-by-step guide, you can integrate Keycloak with Kubernetes and manage user access based on their assigned scope. Users will be authenticated via Keycloak, and their access to Kubernetes resources will be controlled based on the roles and permissions defined in Kubernetes RBAC configuration and mapped from Keycloak groups and scopes. Proper token handling ensures continuous and secure access to Kubernetes resources for authenticated users.


Tokens play a crucial role in the authentication and authorization process when integrating Keycloak with Kubernetes. In this integration, several types of tokens are involved:

Types of Tokens:

Access Token:
Generated by Keycloak upon successful authentication.
Used by the client (Kubernetes) to request access to resources.

ID Token:
Contains claims about the authenticated user.
Used to verify the identity of the user.

Refresh Token:
Allows the client to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate.
Useful for maintaining continuous access to resources without frequent re-authentication.
